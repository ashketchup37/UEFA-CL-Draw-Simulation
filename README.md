# UEFA-CL-Draw-Simulation
A program that simulates the UCL knockout stage draw.<p>
  <i><u><b>Disclaimer: </b></u>This project is actively being build</i>
<p>
  1) I am using python to build this program.<br>
  2) At the moment, I will just build a terminal version. Hopefully in the future, I'll add some GUI to it.<br>
  3) Also, currently it only supports RO16 draw. Gradually I'll add Quarter Final, Semi Final and Group Stage draw simulation.<br>
